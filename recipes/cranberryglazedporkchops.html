    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <img src="../images/cuttingboardpotatos.webp" alt="Potatos on a cutting board">
            <li> Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and
                dry all produce. Dice potatoes into ½-inch
                pieces. Peel and finely chop garlic. Toss
                potatoes on a baking sheet with a large
                drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.
                Roast for 15 minutes (you’ll add the green
                beans then).</li>
            <img src="../images/porkchops.webp" alt="Pork chops in paper towels">
            <li>Meanwhile, pat pork dry with paper towels and
                season all over with salt and pepper; set aside.
                In a medium bowl, toss green beans with a
                drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <img src="../images/greenbeansandpotatos.webp" alt="Green beans and potatos on a baking sheet">
            <li>Once potatoes have roasted 15 minutes,
                remove baking sheet from oven and push
                potatoes to one side. Add green beans to
                empty side. (For 4 servings, leave potatoes
                roasting and add green beans to a second
                sheet.) Continue roasting until veggies are
                browned and tender, 10-12 minutes more.</li>
            <img src="../images/chopsonpan.webp" alt="Pork chop being cooked on a pan">
            <li>While veggies roast, heat a drizzle of oil in a
                large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork
                and cook until browned and cooked through,
                4-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer to
                a plate and set aside.</li>
            <img src="../images/chopsauce.webp" alt="Sauce being made in a pan">
            <li>Heat pan used for pork over medium-high
                heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30
                seconds. Stir in stock concentrate, jam,
                and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4 servings).
                Cook, stirring, until thickened and glossy,
                2-3 minutes. Turn off heat; stir in 1 TBSP
                butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted.</li>
            <img src="../images/chopplate.webp" alt="Cranberry Pork Chops being plated">
            <li>Return pork to pan and turn to coat in sauce.
                Divide pork and roasted veggies between
                plates. Top pork with any remaining sauce.</li>
